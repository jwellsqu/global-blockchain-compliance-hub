South Africa South African contract law developed from Roman Dutch legal principles. There are five requirements that must be met before a valid contract can exist: 
- Consensus: this is similar to the English common law requirement of reaching agreement
- Contractual capacity: the parties must have the necessary capacity to be able to form legal intent for the purpose of concluding a contract
- Lawfulness: the contract must be lawful and not contrary to the common law, any statute, public policy or good morals (for example, a contract to conclude an illegal activity, such as purchase and sale of illegal drugs would not be enforceable)
- Physical possibility: performance of the contract must be determined or determinable at its conclusion (for example, if A agrees to sell its entire yield of corn crop to B for a price per ton, although A does not know exactly how much crop they will yield, the amount and price is capable of being determined at a future date)
- Dormalities: the contract must comply with any requirements prescribed by law or between the parties themselves (for example, an ante-nuptial contract must be in writing and signed in the presence of a notary public). 

Formation of electronic contracts: the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 2002 (ECTA) gives communications via data messages the same effect as non-electronic documents. This means that if there is a requirement to have a document in writing, the ECTA gives the same legal effect to that document in electronic format. 97 “Data” is defined as “electronic representations of information in any form”, and “Data message” is defined as “data generated, sent, received or stored by electronic means”. This would include online transactions and data sent via emails. 

Consensus – offer and acceptance: section 22 of the ECTA concerns the formation of electronic agreements and states that “an agreement concluded between parties by means of data messages is concluded at the time when and place where the acceptance of the offer was received by the offeror.” 

Section 23 of the ECTA deals with the time and place of communications, dispatch and receipt, and states that a data message must be regarded as having been received:
- By the addressee when the complete data message enters an information system designated or used for that purpose by the addressee and is capable of being retrieved and processed by the addressee (for example, when an email arrives in an inbox)
- At the addressee’s usual place of business or residence. 

Section 26 of the ECTA states that “an acknowledgement of receipt of a data message is not necessary to give legal effect to that message.” 

In relation to smart contracts, we suggest that the contract might be concluded when Party 1’s information system receives a notification that Party 2 has accepted the “offer”, and is concluded at Party 1’s usual place of business. 

However, the parties might instead first agree terms “off the ledger”, including which parts of the agreement will be coded into self-executing instructions as a smart contract. Nothing in the ECTA prevents parties from entering into agreements that are partly physical and partly electronic, but the parties must ensure that nothing in the contract precludes them from using both methods.
