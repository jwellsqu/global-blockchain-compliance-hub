# Token Sales (“ICOs”)
In a [joint press statement](https://www.iosco.org/library/ico-statements/Spain%20-%20CNMV%20and%20Banco%20de%20Espana%20-%20Joint%20Statement%20on%20Cryptocurrencies%20and%20ICOs.pdf) with the Bank of Spain in February 2018, the National Securities Market Commission (“CNMV”) emphasized that, to date, *“no cryptocurrency issue or ICO [had] been registered, authorised or verified by any supervisory agencies in Spain…”* adding that, *“there are no ICO-issued cryptocurrencies or tokens purchased or held in Spain that may avail of any of the guarantees or safeguards envisaged under the regulations on banking or investment products.”*

While there is not a mature legal framework for token sales at this time, it has been reported that [members of a Spanish political party](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/rajoy-s-party-weighs-tax-breaks-for-spanish-blockchain-companies) are actively working on ICO-friendly legislation, including otential tax breaks.
